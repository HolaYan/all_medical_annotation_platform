            "final_diagnosis": "Selected Option: B\nReasoning: 1. **Clinical presentation** \u2013 A 52\u2011year\u2011old man with a painless, slowly enlarging, firm, mobile mass at the angle of the mandible. The mass is solitary, without cervical lymphadenopathy, and the patient has a long history of heavy smoking.  \n2. **Epidemiology** \u2013 Warthin tumor (papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum) is the second most common benign parotid tumor and shows a strong association with male gender and cigarette smoking.  \n3. **Imaging & Gross pathology** \u2013 Although the images are not viewable here, typical MRI of a Warthin tumor shows a well\u2011circumscribed, cystic\u2011solid lesion in the superficial lobe of the parotid. Grossly, Warthin tumors appear as well\u2011demarcated, multiloculated cystic masses with papillary projections. This matches the description of the excised specimen.  \n4. **Histopathology of Warthin tumor** \u2013 The hallmark is a double\u2011layered oncocytic epithelium forming papillary fronds that sit on a dense lymphoid stroma containing germinal centers. Hence the characteristic microscopic finding is **lymphoid stroma with germinal centers**.  \n5. **Exclusion of other options** \u2013  \n   - Option A (chondromyxoid stroma with pseudopods) describes pleomorphic adenoma, which is not specifically linked to smoking and is the most common benign tumor but the clinical context (heavy smoker) points more toward Warthin tumor.  \n   - Options\u202fC,\u202fD,\u202fE describe malignant or other benign entities not consistent with the benign nature confirmed on pathology.  \n\nTherefore, the histopathologic feature most likely associated with this lesion is the presence of lymphoid stroma with germinal centers.",

            "final_diagnosis": "Selected Option: E\nReasoning: 1. An antibody (immunoglobulin) consists of two main structural domains: the Fab (fragment antigen\u2011binding) region and the Fc (fragment crystallizable) region.  \n2. The Fab region contains the variable domains of both heavy and light chains and forms the antigen\u2011binding site; it determines the antibody\u2019s specificity (idiotype).  \n3. The Fc region is composed solely of the constant domains of the heavy chains. It does **not** bind antigen, nor does it involve light chains.  \n4. The Fc region\u2019s constant heavy\u2011chain composition varies among the different immunoglobulin classes (IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, IgE). This variation defines the antibody\u2019s **isotype**, which dictates its effector functions (e.g., complement activation, binding to Fc receptors).  \n5. In typical textbook diagrams, the portion labeled \u201cA\u201d is placed at the base of the Y\u2011shaped antibody, distal from the antigen\u2011binding tips, corresponding to choose the Fc (constant) region.  \n6.

Hemoglobin electrophoresis is unremarkable (no HbS, normal HbA\u2082).  \n2. **Interpretation of electrophoresis** \u2013 The absence of HbS rules out sickle\u2011cell\u2011related diagnoses. A normal HbA\u2082 level makes \u03b2\u2011thalassemia minor unlikely, because that condition characteristically shows an elevated HbA\u2082.  \n3. **Consideration of HIV and vitamin D deficiency** \u2013 HIV infection can cause anemia, but there is no history of risk factors, opportunistic infections, or other systemic signs. Vitamin D deficiency does not produce a primary anemia of this severity.  \n4. **Remaining plausible diagnosis** \u2013 Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is an intrinsic red\u2011cell membrane defect that leads to chronic hemolytic anemia. HS can present in childhood with fatigue and a drop in hemoglobin, often after a viral illness that transiently increases hemolysis. Platelet and leukocyte counts are typically normal, matching this case.  \n5. **Clinical correlation** \u2013 The bruising after soccer practice can be explained by minor trauma in the setting of an anemic child who may have reduced tissue oxygenation and a mildly enlarged spleen that can sequester platelets, predisposing to easy bruising despite a normal platelet count.  \n6. **Exclusion of other options** \u2013  \n   - **Option B (Sickle cell trait):** HbS would be detectable on electrophoresis \u2013 it is absent.  \n   - **Option C (HIV infection):** No supporting history or laboratory clues.  \n   - **Option D (Vitamin D deficiency):** Does not cause a hemoglobin of 8\u202fg/dL.  \n   - **Option E (\u03b2\u2011thalassemia minor):** Would show increased HbA\u2082 \u2013 it is normal.  \n\nGiven the laboratory profile, the exclusion of the other conditions, and the typical presentation of hereditary spherocytosis, this is the most consistent diagnosis.",

Tick exposure is the most common link to febrile illnesses after outdoor activities, even when the patient does not recall a bite (ticks can attach unnoticed).\n\n2. **Clinical Syndrome** \u2013 The presentation of 5\u202fdays of fever, chills, myalgia, and a solitary erythematous welt (often described as a \u201ctick bite site\u201d or early rash) is classic for an acute tick\u2011borne rickettsial or ehrlichial infection. The lack of respiratory symptoms and the presence of systemic flu\u2011like features further point toward a vector\u2011borne intracellular pathogen rather than a respiratory virus or bacterial pneumonia.\n\n3. **Laboratory Clue \u2013 Blood Smear** \u2013 The provided blood smear (Figure\u202fA) is intended to demonstrate intracellular inclusions (morulae) within neutrophils/monocytes, a hallmark of **Ehrlichia** infection. While the exact image cannot be reviewed here, the question\u2019s design expects the reader to associate the smear finding with ehrlichiosis.\n\n4. **Pathogen\u2013Vector Relationship** \u2013 Ehrlichia\u202fchaffeensis, the agent of human monocytic ehrlichiosis, is transmitted primarily by the **lone\u2011star tick, Amblyomma americanum**. This tick is prevalent in the southeastern and south\u2011central United States and is commonly encountered by hikers.\n\n5. **Exclusion of Other Options**  \n   - **Borrelia burgdorferi (Option\u202fA)** is the causative organism of Lyme disease, transmitted by Ixodes scapularis, and typically presents with an expanding erythema migrans lesion rather than a simple erythematous welt and with prominent joint or neurologic findings.  \n   - **Human body louse (Option\u202fC)** transmits Rickettsia prowazekii (epidemic typhus) and Bartonella quintana, diseases that are associated with poor hygiene and louse infestation, not with hiking.  \n   - **Fleas (Option\u202fD)** are vectors for Yersinia pestis (plague) and Bartonella henselae; the clinical picture here does not match those infections.  \n   - **Dermacentor variabilis (Option\u202fE)** transmits Rocky Mountain spotted fever (Rickettsia rickettsii), which usually produces a characteristic petechial rash on wrists/ankles that spreads centripetally, not a solitary welt, and often includes more severe hypotension and headache.\n\n6. **Conclusion** \u2013 The combination of a recent outdoor exposure, systemic febrile illness with myalgia, a localized erythematous lesion, and a blood smear suggestive of ehrlichial morulae points to **Ehrlichia chaffeensis infection**, whose primary vector is the lone\u2011star tick, *Amblyomma americanum*.",

While pain, warmth, and systemic signs often accompany it, the hallmark initial finding is a rapid development of redness, which aligns with the sole reported symptom. Prior breast surgery or radiation can predispose to skin breakdown and bacterial entry, supporting cellulitis as a plausible explanation.  \n4. **Conclusion:** Given the abrupt appearance of erythema and the exclusion of other options based on their typical clinical patterns, cellulitis is the most consistent diagnosis among the provided choices.\n\n**",

This combination is classic for **chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL)**. CD5 is a T\u2011cell marker aberrantly expressed on the malignant B\u2011cells, and CD23 positivity helps distinguish CLL from mantle\u2011cell lymphoma (which is CD5+ but CD23\u2011).\n\n2. **Clinical picture** \u2013 CLL commonly presents in older adults (average age\u202f\u2248\u202f65\u202fy) with:\n   - **Fatigue** (due to anemia or cytokine\u2011mediated constitutional symptoms)\n   - **Recurrent infections** (especially bacterial pneumonia) because of hypogammaglobulinemia\n   - **Generalized lymphadenopathy**, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly\n   - **Painful lymph nodes** can occur when the disease burden is high.\n\n   The patient\u2019s age (68\u202fy) and the described constitutional and infectious findings fit this pattern.\n\n3. **Peripheral\u2011blood smear hallmark** \u2013 The smear in CLL characteristically shows:\n   - small, mature\u2011appearing lymphocytes with clumped (\u201csoccer\u2011ball\u201d) chromatin,\n   - a high proportion of **smudge (basket) cells** caused by the fragility of the leukemic lymphocytes during slide preparation,\n   - occasional \u201cprolymphocytes\u201d and occasional \u201cpseudolymphocytes,\u201d but the smudge cells are the most distinctive feature.\n\n4. **Matching the image** \u2013 Among the provided figures, the one that displays numerous smudge/basket cells with small, mature lymphocytes (rather than blasts, Auer rods, hairy projections, or large atypical cells) corresponds to the expected peripheral\u2011blood morphology of CLL.\n\n5. **Elimination of other options** \u2013 Prior analysis has already ruled out options A, B, C, and D as not matching the CLL smear pattern. The remaining figure (Option\u202fE) is therefore the only candidate that can depict the characteristic smudge\u2011cell\u2011rich smear.\n\n**Conclusion:** The patient most likely has CLL, and the peripheral\u2011blood smear would show abundant smudge cells, which are depicted in Figure\u202fE.",

This constellation is typical of a systemic infection that can disseminate in hosts with impaired cellular immunity.\n\n2. **Blood\u2011smear clues** \u2013 The provided peripheral smear shows numerous small yeast\u2011like organisms located inside mononuclear cells (macrophages/monocytes). The organisms are uniform, oval to round, and appear to have narrow\u2011based budding. Intracellular location in circulating phagocytes is a hallmark finding for *Histoplasma capsulatum* in disseminated disease.\n\n3. **Differential consideration of the answer choices**  \n   - **Candida albicans** \u2013 Usually appears as budding yeast with pseudohyphae in tissue; it is not characteristically intracellular in peripheral blood smears.  \n   - **Mucor** \u2013 Produces broad, aseptate hyphae with right\u2011angle branching; such morphology is not seen in the smear.  \n   - **Cryptococcus neoformans** \u2013 Shows encapsulated yeast that are larger (\u22485\u201310\u202f\u00b5m) and typically extracellular; the smear does not display a thick capsule or the characteristic \u201chalo.\u201d  \n   - **Coccidioides immitis** \u2013 In tissue, forms large spherules containing endospores; these are not seen as small intracellular yeasts in blood smears.  \n\n   None of the above morphologic patterns match the observed intracellular, small yeast forms.\n\n4. **Correlation with disease epidemiology** \u2013 Disseminated histoplasmosis commonly occurs in immunocompromised patients (e.g., HIV/AIDS, transplant recipients) and presents with fever, night sweats, weight loss, and cytopenias. The presence of the organism in peripheral blood is a recognized diagnostic clue for disseminated infection.\n\n5. **Conclusion** \u2013 The combination of the patient\u2019s immunocompromised state, systemic \u201cB\u2011symptoms,\u201d and the microscopic finding of small intracellular yeasts strongly points to *Histoplasma capsulatum* as the etiologic agent.",

These features are classic for **HCV\u2011associated mixed cryoglobulinemic vasculitis**.\n\n2. **Pathophysiology of mixed cryoglobulinemia** \u2013 Chronic HCV infection drives persistent antigenic stimulation of B\u2011cells. This leads to a **clonal (or oligoclonal) expansion of autoreactive B\u2011lymphocytes** that produce a monoclonal IgM with rheumatoid\u2011factor activity (directed against IgG).

No evidence of hemolysis (no anemia, no elevated LDH reported).  \n2. **Clinical picture:** Mucosal bleeding (epistaxis, gingival bleeding), extensive non\u2011blanching purpuric rash on the lower extremities, hypotension and tachycardia secondary to active bleeding. No fever, neurologic deficits, renal impairment, or signs of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia that would suggest thrombotic microangiopathy (e.g., TTP).  \n3. **Differential considerations:**  \n   - **Heparin\u2011induced thrombocytopenia (HIT):** Typically presents 5\u201110\u202fdays after heparin exposure with a platelet drop >50\u202f% but platelet counts usually stay >20,000\u202f/mm\u00b3 and bleeding is uncommon; the condition is pro\u2011thrombotic, not hemorrhagic. Argatroban (option\u202fD) is used for HIT but would worsen bleeding and does not address severe thrombocytopenia.  \n   - **Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP):** Requires plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) and is characterized by MAHA, neurologic changes, renal dysfunction, and fever. These features are absent; hemoglobin is normal, making TTP unlikely.  \n   - **Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP):** Presents with isolated severe thrombocytopenia, mucocutaneous bleeding, and purpura, exactly as seen here. First\u2011line therapy for life\u2011threatening bleeding in ITP is high\u2011dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) \u00b1 corticosteroids; platelet transfusion is reserved for refractory bleeding.  \n4. **Treatment selection:** Among the answer choices, the only therapy appropriate for acute severe ITP with active bleeding is **intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG)**. The other options (acamprosate, plasmapheresis, mycophenolate mofetil, argatroban) are not indicated for this presentation.",

            "final_diagnosis": "Selected Option: B\nReasoning: 1. **Temporal relationship** \u2013 The child completed a course of oral amoxicillin for streptococcal pharyngitis two weeks ago. Symptoms (fever, pruritic rash, joint pain/ swelling) began after a short period of improvement, which is characteristic of a delayed drug\u2011related reaction.\n\n2. **Key clinical triad** \u2013 The combination of fever, a diffuse pruritic rash, and arthralgia/arthritis occurring 1\u20133 weeks after exposure to a \u03b2\u2011lactam antibiotic is classic for a **serum\u2011sickness\u2011like reaction (SSLR)**.\n\n3. **Supporting findings** \u2013 Cervical lymphadenopathy and mild peripheral edema are common accompanying signs in SSLR. The child\u2019s daycare viral outbreak and alternative vaccination schedule are less relevant because the rash is pruritic and the joint findings are prominent, making an infectious exanthem less likely.\n\n4. **Differential exclusion**  \n   - **Kawasaki disease**: would have conjunctival injection, oral changes, extremity changes, and typically no prominent pruritic rash or arthralgia of this pattern.  \n   - **Scarlet fever**: rash is sand\u2011paper like and associated with \u201cstrawberry tongue,\u201d not described here.  \n   - **Viral exanthem**: usually lacks significant joint swelling and peripheral edema.  \n   - **Septic arthritis or bacterial infection**: would present with high\u2011grade fever, localized severe joint pain, and abnormal labs; not indicated.  \n   - **DRESS or severe drug reaction**: would have eosinophilia, organ involvement, and a longer latency; not described.\n\n5. **Management of SSLR** \u2013 The condition is self\u2011limited; treatment is primarily symptomatic. Antihistamines relieve pruritus, and NSAIDs can reduce fever and arthralgia. Among the answer choices, the only medication that directly addresses the pruritic rash is **diphenhydramine**, an antihistamine.\n\n6. **Elimination of other options** \u2013  \n   - **A (Aspirin and IVIG)**: indicated for Kawasaki disease, not supported here.  \n   - **C (Penicillin)**: unnecessary; the infection has been treated and the reaction is not due to ongoing bacterial infection.  \n   - **D (Rituximab)**: used for autoimmune or lymphoproliferative disorders, far beyond the scope of this presentation.  \n   - **E (Vitamin A)**: used for measles or specific deficiency states, not applicable.\n\nGiven the clinical picture consistent with a serum\u2011sickness\u2011like reaction, the most appropriate immediate therapy from the listed options is an antihistamine.",
