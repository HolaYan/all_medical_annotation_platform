Clinical Information**  \n- Age: 70\u202fy/o female.  \n- Recent viral respiratory infection (preceding week).  \n- New\u2011onset dizziness (could be related to anemia, hypoxia, or autonomic changes).  \n- Rash appeared after the infection and is widespread.\n\n**3. Medical Knowledge**  \n- **Non\u2011blanching purplish macules** are typical of **purpura/petechiae** or **livedo\u2011type** (cutis marmorata) lesions.  \n- **Cutis marmorata** (livedo reticularis) is a net\u2011like, violaceous, non\u2011blanching pattern caused by sluggish venous blood flow or small\u2011vessel occlusion. It can be physiologic in infants but in adults may appear secondary to cold exposure, vasculitis, antiphospholipid syndrome, or after viral infections that provoke a transient hypercoagulable state.  \n- **Erythema infectiosum** (fifth disease) presents with a \u201cslapped\u2011cheek\u201d erythema and a lacy reticular rash on the trunk, not a generalized purplish non\u2011blanching rash, and it occurs in children.  \n- **Cutaneous larva migrans** produces an intensely pruritic, serpiginous, erythematous track; it is not purplish and is localized, not generalized.  \n- **Cold agglutinin disease** is a hemolytic anemia triggered by cold; skin findings are usually acrocyanosis or Raynaud\u2011type changes, not a diffuse purplish macular rash.  \n- **Erythema ab\u2011igne** results from chronic heat exposure and appears as a reticulated hyperpigmented patch, developing over weeks to months, not acutely after a viral illness.\n\n**4. Differential Diagnosis**  \n- **Purpura/petechiae** (e.g., ITP) \u2013 would be non\u2011blanching but usually presents as pinpoint spots, not a uniform macular rash.  \n- **Livedo reticularis / cutis marmorata** \u2013 fits the description of a generalized violaceous, non\u2011blanching macular pattern.  \n- Other options (A, B, C, E) do not match the rash morphology, age group, or temporal relationship to a viral infection.\n\n**5. Option Evaluation**  \n- **(A) Erythema infectiosum** \u2013 Incorrect: age, rash type, and distribution do not fit.  \n- **(B) Cutaneous larva migrans** \u2013 Incorrect: lesion is serpiginous, localized, and pruritic.  \n- **(C) Cold agglutinin disease** \u2013 Incorrect: primary manifestation is hemolysis with cold\u2011induced cyanosis, not a generalized non\u2011blanching purplish macular rash.  \n- **(D) Cutis marmorata** \u2013 Correct: describes a generalized, violaceous, non\u2011blanching macular rash (livedo\u2011type) that can appear after a viral infection in older adults.  \n- **(E) Erythema ab\u2011igne** \u2013 Incorrect: requires chronic heat exposure and shows a reticulated hyperpigmentation, not an acute purplish rash.\n\n**6.

Image Analysis**  \n*No image is provided, but the description states a \u201cgeneralized, macular, purplish rash that does not blanch with pressure.\u201d*  \n- Macular\u202f=\u202fflat lesions.  \n- Purplish\u202f=\u202fviolaceous color, suggesting deoxygenated blood in the skin.  \n- Non\u2011blanching\u202f=\u202fthe color persists when the lesion is pressed, indicating that the discoloration is due to blood that is extravasated or trapped within vessels (e.g., petechiae, purpura, or a livedo\u2011type pattern) rather than vasodilation.\n\n**2. Clinical Information**  \n- Age: 70\u202fy/o female.  \n- Recent viral respiratory infection (preceding week).  \n- New\u2011onset dizziness (could be related to anemia, hypoxia, or autonomic changes).  \n- Rash appeared after the infection and is widespread.\n\n**3. Medical Knowledge**  \n- **Non\u2011blanching purplish macules** are typical of **purpura/petechiae** or **livedo\u2011type** (cutis marmorata) lesions.  \n- **Cutis marmorata** (livedo reticularis) is a net\u2011like, violaceous, non\u2011blanching pattern caused by sluggish venous blood flow or small\u2011vessel occlusion. It can be physiologic in infants but in adults may appear secondary to cold exposure, vasculitis, antiphospholipid syndrome, or after viral infections that provoke a transient hypercoagulable state.  \n- **Erythema infectiosum** (fifth disease) presents with a \u201cslapped\u2011cheek\u201d erythema and a lacy reticular rash on the trunk, not a generalized purplish non\u2011blanching rash, and it occurs in children.  \n- **Cutaneous larva migrans** produces an intensely pruritic, serpiginous, erythematous track; it is not purplish and is localized, not generalized.  \n- **Cold agglutinin disease** is a hemolytic anemia triggered by cold; skin findings are usually acrocyanosis or Raynaud\u2011type changes, not a diffuse purplish macular rash.  \n- **Erythema ab\u2011igne** results from chronic heat exposure and appears as a reticulated hyperpigmented patch, developing over weeks to months, not acutely after a viral illness.\n\n**4. Differential Diagnosis**  \n- **Purpura/petechiae** (e.g., ITP) \u2013 would be non\u2011blanching but usually presents as pinpoint spots, not a uniform macular rash.  \n- **Livedo reticularis / cutis marmorata** \u2013 fits the description of a generalized violaceous, non\u2011blanching macular pattern.  \n- Other options (A, B, C, E) do not match the rash morphology, age group, or temporal relationship to a viral infection.\n\n**5. Option Evaluation**  \n- **(A) Erythema infectiosum** \u2013 Incorrect: age, rash type, and distribution do not fit.  \n- **(B) Cutaneous larva migrans** \u2013 Incorrect: lesion is serpiginous, localized, and pruritic.  \n- **(C) Cold agglutinin disease** \u2013 Incorrect: primary manifestation is hemolysis with cold\u2011induced cyanosis, not a generalized non\u2011blanching purplish macular rash.  \n- **(D) Cutis marmorata** \u2013 Correct: describes a generalized, violaceous, non\u2011blanching macular rash (livedo\u2011type) that can appear after a viral infection in older adults.  \n- **(E) Erythema ab\u2011igne** \u2013 Incorrect: requires chronic heat exposure and shows a reticulated hyperpigmentation, not an acute purplish rash.\n\n**6. Clinical Decision**  \nThe presentation most closely aligns with **cutis marmorata (livedo reticularis)**, a non\u2011blanching violaceous macular rash that can be precipitated by a recent viral illness in an elderly patient.\n\n**Final Answer: D**"

            "question": "A previously healthy 34-year-old male presents to his primary care physician with a 5-day history of fever, chills, and myalgia. He initially suspected a common cold but notes the absence of respiratory symptoms and persistence of fever and pain. His history reveals hiking activity two weeks ago, though he doesn't recall any tick bites. Physical examination shows temperature of 100.9\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure 110/84 mmHg, pulse 87/min, and respirations 14/min. A full body skin examination reveals an erythematous welt on the posterior thigh, with otherwise normal findings. Laboratory testing includes a blood smear shown in Figure A. Which vector is most likely responsible for transmitting this patient's disease?\nAnswer Choices: (A) Borrelia burgdorferi (B) Amblyomma americanum (C) Human body louse (D) Fleas (E) Dermacentor variabilis",
