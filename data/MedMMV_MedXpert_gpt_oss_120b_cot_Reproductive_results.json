Typical benign findings on US include:*\n   - **Simple cyst** \u2013 anechoic, well\u2011circumscribed, posterior acoustic enhancement, thin wall.  \n   - **Fibroadenoma** \u2013 solid, oval, parallel orientation, homogeneous hypoechoic, smooth margins, often \u22642\u202fcm.  \n   *Because the question asks for the next step after the US, the image most likely demonstrates a simple cyst (the classic scenario for a tender, fluctuating mass in a young woman).*\n\n2. **Clinical Information**  \n   - Age\u202f27 \u2192 breast tissue still dense; ultrasound is the preferred initial imaging modality.  \n   - Tender, firm lump, no skin changes, no nipple discharge, no axillary nodes \u2192 low suspicion for malignancy.  \n   - Family history (grandmother with breast cancer at 70) confers only modest risk; not a high\u2011risk pedigree.  \n   - Vital signs are essentially normal.\n\n3. **Medical Knowledge**  \n   - **Breast evaluation algorithm** for women <30: start with ultrasound.  \n   - If US shows a **simple cyst**, the next step is **ultrasound\u2011guided fine\u2011needle aspiration (FNA)** to relieve symptoms and confirm the cystic nature.  \n   - If the cyst resolves after aspiration and the fluid is clear, no further work\u2011up is needed.  \n   - If the US shows a solid mass with suspicious features, a core\u2011needle (or excisional) biopsy would be indicated, but that is not among the answer choices.  \n   - Mammography is not first\u2011line in women <30 unless the US is inconclusive or the patient is high\u2011risk.  \n   - Reassurance alone is inappropriate when a cystic lesion is identified; aspiration is both diagnostic and therapeutic.  \n   - Excisional or surgical excision is reserved for lesions that are suspicious or persist after aspiration.\n\n4. **Differential Diagnosis**  \n   - **Simple cyst** \u2013 most likely given tenderness, age, and typical US appearance.  \n   - **Fibroadenoma** \u2013 possible, but the question\u2019s emphasis on \u201ctender\u201d and the classic US picture points toward a cyst.  \n   - **Complex cyst / solid mass** \u2013 would require core\u2011needle biopsy, not listed.  \n   - **Malignancy** \u2013 unlikely given age, exam, and US findings.\n\n5. **Option Evaluation**  \n   - **(A) Fine needle aspiration** \u2013 appropriate for a simple cyst; provides symptom relief and confirms cystic nature.  \n   - **(B) Mammography** \u2013 not indicated as first step in a woman <30 with a benign\u2011appearing US.  \n   - **(C) Reassurance** \u2013 insufficient without confirming the cystic nature.  \n   - **(D) Excisional biopsy** \u2013 overly aggressive for a likely benign cyst.  \n   - **(E) Surgical excision** \u2013 same as above; reserved for persistent or suspicious lesions.\n\n6. **Clinical Decision**  \n   The most appropriate next step after identifying a simple cyst on ultrasound in a young woman is **ultrasound\u2011guided fine\u2011needle aspiration**.\n\n**Final Answer: A**",

Typical benign findings on US include:*\n   - **Simple cyst** \u2013 anechoic, well\u2011circumscribed, posterior acoustic enhancement, thin wall.  \n   - **Fibroadenoma** \u2013 solid, oval, parallel orientation, homogeneous hypoechoic, smooth margins, often \u22642\u202fcm.  \n   *Because the question asks for the next step after the US, the image most likely demonstrates a simple cyst (the classic scenario for a tender, fluctuating mass in a young woman).*\n\n2. **Clinical Information**  \n   - Age\u202f27 \u2192 breast tissue still dense; ultrasound is the preferred initial imaging modality.  \n   - Tender, firm lump, no skin changes, no nipple discharge, no axillary nodes \u2192 low suspicion for malignancy.  \n   - Family history (grandmother with breast cancer at 70) confers only modest risk; not a high\u2011risk pedigree.  \n   - Vital signs are essentially normal.\n\n3. **Medical Knowledge**  \n   - **Breast evaluation algorithm** for women <30: start with ultrasound.  \n   - If US shows a **simple cyst**, the next step is **ultrasound\u2011guided fine\u2011needle aspiration (FNA)** to relieve symptoms and confirm the cystic nature.  \n   - If the cyst resolves after aspiration and the fluid is clear, no further work\u2011up is needed.  \n   - If the US shows a solid mass with suspicious features, a core\u2011needle (or excisional) biopsy would be indicated, but that is not among the answer choices.  \n   - Mammography is not first\u2011line in women <30 unless the US is inconclusive or the patient is high\u2011risk.  \n   - Reassurance alone is inappropriate when a cystic lesion is identified; aspiration is both diagnostic and therapeutic.  \n   - Excisional or surgical excision is reserved for lesions that are suspicious or persist after aspiration.\n\n4. **Differential Diagnosis**  \n   - **Simple cyst** \u2013 most likely given tenderness, age, and typical US appearance.  \n   - **Fibroadenoma** \u2013 possible, but the question\u2019s emphasis on \u201ctender\u201d and the classic US picture points toward a cyst.  \n   - **Complex cyst / solid mass** \u2013 would require core\u2011needle biopsy, not listed.  \n   - **Malignancy** \u2013 unlikely given age, exam, and US findings.\n\n5. **Option Evaluation**  \n   - **(A) Fine needle aspiration** \u2013 appropriate for a simple cyst; provides symptom relief and confirms cystic nature.  \n   - **(B) Mammography** \u2013 not indicated as first step in a woman <30 with a benign\u2011appearing US.  \n   - **(C) Reassurance** \u2013 insufficient without confirming the cystic nature.  \n   - **(D) Excisional biopsy** \u2013 overly aggressive for a likely benign cyst.  \n   - **(E) Surgical excision** \u2013 same as above; reserved for persistent or suspicious lesions.\n\n6. **Clinical Decision**  \n   The most appropriate next step after identifying a simple cyst on ultrasound in a young woman is **ultrasound\u2011guided fine\u2011needle aspiration**.\n\n**Final Answer: A**"

This pattern is classic for a varicocele \u2013 dilation of the pampiniform plexus veins.*\n\n2. **Clinical Information**  \n   - 36\u2011year\u2011old man, painless scrotal enlargement.  \n   - Enlargement becomes more prominent with Valsalva \u2192 venous congestion.  \n   - No fever, dysuria, urethral discharge \u2192 infection unlikely.  \n   - Sexually active with inconsistent barrier protection \u2192 raises concern for STIs, but the physical findings point elsewhere.  \n   - No systemic signs; vitals normal.\n\n3. **Medical Knowledge**  \n   - **Varicocele**: Dilated veins of the pampiniform plexus, usually left\u2011sided, worsens with Valsalva, may be asymptomatic varicoceles.  \n   - Pathophysiology: Increased scrotal temperature and oxidative stress impair spermatogenesis \u2192 **abnormal semen parameters** (decreased count, motility, morphology).  \n   - Other associations: May be linked to infertility; rarely causes pain.  \n   - Not associated with urinary hCG (testicular cancer), chlamydial infection, cremasteric areflexia, or transillumination (hydrocele).\n\n4. **Differential Diagnosis**  \n   - **Hydrocele** \u2013 fluid collection, transilluminates, does not enlarge with Valsalva.  \n   - **Varicocele** \u2013 venous dilation, enlarges with Valsalva, may cause infertility.  \n   - **Epididymitis/orchitis** \u2013 painful, often with systemic signs.  \n   - **Testicular tumor** \u2013 often a solid mass, may produce hCG/AFP, not Valsalva\u2011dependent.  \n   - **Inguinal hernia** \u2013 may enlarge with Valsalva but would be palpable as bowel, not a vascular pattern on US.\n\n   The findings best fit a varicocele.\n\n5. **Option Evaluation**  \n   - **(A**): Increased urinary hCG \u2013 seen with choriocarcinoma, not varicocele.  \n   - **(B)**: Positive Chlamydia NAAT \u2013 would suggest epididymitis; patient is painless.  \n   - **(C)**: Cremasteric areflexia \u2013 not a typical feature of varicocele.  \n   - **(D)**: Abnormal semen analysis \u2013 varicoceles are a known cause of impaired spermatogenesis.  \n   - **(E)**: Positive transillumination \u2013 characteristic of hydrocele, not varicocele.\n\n   The only answer that aligns with the pathophysiology of a varicocele is **(D)**.\n\n6. **Clinical Decision**  \n   The most likely additional finding in this patient with a varicocele is an abnormal semen analysis.\n\n**Final Answer: D**"

The presence of a large sub\u2011dartos hematoma would strongly point toward a penile fracture.\n\n**2. Clinical Information**  \n- **Chief complaint:** Sudden, severe penile pain with immediate loss of erection (detumescence) that occurred during sexual intercourse.  \n- **Typical history for penile fracture:**  \n  - A \u201cpopping\u201d or \u201csnapping\u201d sound at the moment of injury.  \n  - Immediate, intense pain.  \n  - Rapid loss of erection.  \n  - Swelling and bruising of the penis that may develop within minutes to hours.  \n- **Other clues:** No urinary symptoms (hematuria, dysuria) that would suggest urethral injury, and no external skin laceration that would indicate a zipper injury.\n\n**3. Medical Knowledge**  \n- The penis is composed of two corpora cavernosa surrounded by a tough fibrous sheath called the tunica albuginea. During erection the tunica is stretched and thinned, making it vulnerable to rupture from a sudden bending force.  \n- **Penile fracture** = rupture of the tunica albuginea, usually from blunt trauma to an erect penis (e.g., vigorous intercourse, \u201cdog\u2011style\u201d position).  \n- **Urethral rupture** often presents with blood at the meatus, inability to void, and a perineal \u201cbutt\u2011sign\u201d rather than isolated penile pain.  \n- **Traumatic epididymitis** presents with scrotal pain, swelling, and often a history of infection or trauma to the scrotum, not acute detumescence.  \n- **Penile contusion** (bruising) causes pain and discoloration but does not cause immediate loss of erection or a snapping sound.  \n- **Zipper injury** produces a linear laceration or abrasion of the penile skin, often with bleeding, and is usually associated with a \u201czipper\u201d mechanism rather than intercourse.\n\n**4. Differential Diagnosis**  \n| Condition | Typical Features | Fits This Case? |\n|----------|------------------|----------------|\n| **Penile fracture** | Snap sound, sudden severe pain, immediate detumescence, swelling/hematoma, \u201cegg\u2011plant\u201d deformity | **Yes** |\n| Urethral rupture | Blood at meatus, urinary retention, perineal bruising | No (no urinary signs) |\n| Traumatic epididymitis | Scrotal pain/swelling, possible fever, gradual onset | No (pain localized to penis, acute) |\n| Penile contusion | Pain, bruising, no loss of erection, no snap | No (detumescence present) |\n| Zipper injury | Linear skin laceration, bleeding, often no deep pain, no loss of erection | No (deep pain, detumescence) |\n\n**5. Option Evaluation**  \n- **(A) Urethral rupture** \u2013 Lacks hematuria or urinary difficulty; unlikely.  \n- **(B) Traumatic epididymitis** \u2013 Involves scrotum, not acute penile detumescence; unlikely.  \n- **(C) Penile contusion** \u2013 Would not cause immediate loss of erection; unlikely.  \n- **(e) Zipper injury** \u2013 External skin injury, not typical for intercourse\u2011related snap; unlikely.  \n- **(E) Penile fracture** \u2013 Matches classic presentation (snap, severe pain, rapid detumescence, swelling/hematoma).  \n\n**6.

Clinical Information**  \n- **Chief complaint:** Sudden, severe penile pain with immediate loss of erection (detumescence) that occurred during sexual intercourse.  \n- **Typical history for penile fracture:**  \n  - A \u201cpopping\u201d or \u201csnapping\u201d sound at the moment of injury.  \n  - Immediate, intense pain.  \n  - Rapid loss of erection.  \n  - Swelling and bruising of the penis that may develop within minutes to hours.  \n- **Other clues:** No urinary symptoms (hematuria, dysuria) that would suggest urethral injury, and no external skin laceration that would indicate a zipper injury.\n\n**3. Medical Knowledge**  \n- The penis is composed of two corpora cavernosa surrounded by a tough fibrous sheath called the tunica albuginea. During erection the tunica is stretched and thinned, making it vulnerable to rupture from a sudden bending force.  \n- **Penile fracture** = rupture of the tunica albuginea, usually from blunt trauma to an erect penis (e.g., vigorous intercourse, \u201cdog\u2011style\u201d position).  \n- **Urethral rupture** often presents with blood at the meatus, inability to void, and a perineal \u201cbutt\u2011sign\u201d rather than isolated penile pain.  \n- **Traumatic epididymitis** presents with scrotal pain, swelling, and often a history of infection or trauma to the scrotum, not acute detumescence.  \n- **Penile contusion** (bruising) causes pain and discoloration but does not cause immediate loss of erection or a snapping sound.  \n- **Zipper injury** produces a linear laceration or abrasion of the penile skin, often with bleeding, and is usually associated with a \u201czipper\u201d mechanism rather than intercourse.\n\n**4. Differential Diagnosis**  \n| Condition | Typical Features | Fits This Case? |\n|----------|------------------|----------------|\n| **Penile fracture** | Snap sound, sudden severe pain, immediate detumescence, swelling/hematoma, \u201cegg\u2011plant\u201d deformity | **Yes** |\n| Urethral rupture | Blood at meatus, urinary retention, perineal bruising | No (no urinary signs) |\n| Traumatic epididymitis | Scrotal pain/swelling, possible fever, gradual onset | No (pain localized to penis, acute) |\n| Penile contusion | Pain, bruising, no loss of erection, no snap | No (detumescence present) |\n| Zipper injury | Linear skin laceration, bleeding, often no deep pain, no loss of erection | No (deep pain, detumescence) |\n\n**5. Option Evaluation**  \n- **(A) Urethral rupture** \u2013 Lacks hematuria or urinary difficulty; unlikely.  \n- **(B) Traumatic epididymitis** \u2013 Involves scrotum, not acute penile detumescence; unlikely.  \n- **(C) Penile contusion** \u2013 Would not cause immediate loss of erection; unlikely.  \n- **(e) Zipper injury** \u2013 External skin injury, not typical for intercourse\u2011related snap; unlikely.  \n- **(E) Penile fracture** \u2013 Matches classic presentation (snap, severe pain, rapid detumescence, swelling/hematoma).  \n\n**6. Clinical Decision**  \nThe most consistent diagnosis with the described acute penile pain and immediate detumescence during intercourse is a rupture of the tunica albuginea\u2014**penile fracture**.\n\n**Final Answer: E**"
