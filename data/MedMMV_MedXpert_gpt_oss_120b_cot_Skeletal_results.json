Night pain that is markedly relieved by NSAIDs is characteristic of osteoid osteoma. The history of a soccer injury is probably incidental.\n\n3. **Medical knowledge** \u2013 Osteoid osteoma is a benign bone\u2011forming tumor that occurs in adolescents, most often in the cortex of long bones around the knee. Histologically it consists of a central nidus of woven bone and osteoid lined by active osteoblasts, set in a highly vascular stroma, with surrounding reactive sclerosis.\n\n4. **Differential diagnosis** \u2013  \n   \u2022 **Osteosarcoma** \u2013 would present with a painful, enlarging mass, mixed lytic\u2011sclerotic lesion, aggressive periosteal reaction; histology shows malignant pleomorphic cells producing osteoid.  \n  \u202f\u2022 **Ewing sarcoma** \u2013 diaphyseal lesion, systemic symptoms, \u201conion\u2011skin\u201d periosteal reaction; histology shows sheets of small round blue cells.  \n  \u202f\u2022 **Osteoblastoma** \u2013 larger (>2\u202fcm) nidus, less reactive sclerosis; histology similar but larger lesion.  \n  \u202f\u2022 **Chondrosarcoma** \u2013 cartilage matrix, older patients.  \n\n   The imaging and night\u2011pain pattern fit osteoid osteoma best, making the other entities unlikely.\n\n5. **Option evaluation** \u2013 Among the provided histology panels (Figures\u202fB\u2011F), the one that displays a small nidus of woven bone with prominent osteoblast rimming and a vascular stroma corresponds to osteoid osteoma. That pattern is shown in **Figure\u202fB**.\n\n6. **Clinical decision** \u2013 The biopsy most likely matches the histology of an osteoid osteoma.\n\n**Final Answer: (C) Figure\u202fB**"
