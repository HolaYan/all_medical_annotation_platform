Clinical Information**  \n- 76\u2011year\u2011old man with an acute\u2011onset chest pain \u2192 likely an acute myocardial infarction (MI).  \n- Three days after admission he develops severe dyspnea and dies despite treatment.  \n- Free\u2011wall rupture most often occurs 3\u20137\u202fdays after an MI, when the necrotic myocardium is weakest. The rupture can be either free (leading to tamponade) or *contained* (forming a pseudo\u2011aneurysm). A contained rupture can produce sudden hemodynamic collapse and respiratory distress.\n\n**3. Medical Knowledge**  \n- **True aneurysm** (post\u2011MI) involves all layers of the ventricular wall and has a wide neck; it usually develops weeks to months later.  \n- **Pseudoaneurysm** results from a tear in the myocardial wall that is sealed by the pericardium, producing a narrow neck and a thin, fragile sac. It is a surgical emergency because it can rupture catastrophically.  \n- Septal rupture (ventricular septal defect) presents with a harsh holosystolic murmur and a left\u2011to\u2011right shunt, not with a saccular LV out\u2011pouching.  \n- Posterior descending artery occlusion, infective endocarditis, and fibrinous pericarditis are unrelated to the gross LV morphology shown.\n\n**4. Differential Diagnosis**  \n- **Rupture of the interventricular septum** \u2013 would show a defect in the septum, not a LV out\u2011pouching.  \n- **Pseudoaneurysm of the LV** \u2013 matches the narrow\u2011neck, saccular lesion seen.  \n- **Occlusion of the posterior descending artery** \u2013 a coronary lesion, not a structural LV change.  \n- **Bacterial infection of the mitral valve** \u2013 would produce vegetations on the valve, not LV wall dilation.  \n- **Exudative pericarditis** \u2013 would show a thickened pericardial sac, not a ventricular pseudo\u2011aneurysm.\n\n**5. Option Evaluation**  \n- **(A) Rupture of the interventricular septum** \u2013 inconsistent with the image.  \n- **(B)\u202fPseudoaneurysmatic dilation of the left ventricle** \u2013 perfectly fits the narrow\u2011neck, saccular out\u2011pouching seen after a contained free\u2011wall rupture.  \n- **(C) Occlusion of the posterior descending artery** \u2013 a coronary finding, not a morphological LV lesion.  \n- **(D) Bacterial infection of the mitral valve endocardium** \u2013 would show vegetations, not present.  \n- **(E) Exudative inflammation of the pericardium** \u2013 would present as a fibrinous or serofibrinous pericardial layer, not a ventricular pseudo\u2011aneurysm.\n\n**6. Clinical Decision**  \nThe most likely underlying factor that led to the patient\u2019s sudden deterioration and death is the formation of a **pseudoaneurysm** resulting from a contained rupture of the left\u2011ventricular free wall after myocardial infarction.\n\n**Final Answer: B**"

Multiple distinct P\u2011wave morphologies are visible (\u2265\u202f3), and the PR intervals vary from beat to beat. No clear \u201csaw\u2011tooth\u201d flutter waves are present, and the QRS complexes are narrow.\n\n**2. Clinical Information**  \n- 72\u2011year\u2011old man with fever, cough, crackles, and a right\u2011lower\u2011lobe infiltrate \u2192 acute lower\u2011respiratory\u2011tract infection (pneumonia).  \n- Active smoker, history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  \n- During evaluation he becomes tachycardic.  \n- Older age and acute pulmonary disease are classic precipitants of arrhythmias that are driven by hypoxia and catecholamine surge.\n\n**3. Medical Knowledge**  \n- **Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia (MAT)**: Irregularly irregular rhythm, HR\u202f>\u202f100\u202fbpm, \u2265\u202f3 different P\u2011wave morphologies, variable PR intervals, narrow QRS. Common in patients with COPD, pneumonia, or any acute hypoxic lung disease, especially in the elderly.  \n- **Atrial Fibrillation (AF) with variable block**: Irregularly irregular rhythm but no discernible P waves; instead, chaotic fibrillatory (f) waves are seen.  \n- **Atrial Flutter**: Typically regular (saw\u2011tooth flutter waves) unless variable block is present, but the baseline rhythm is usually regular.  \n- **AVNRT / Orthodromic AVRT**: Regular narrow\u2011complex tachycardias (150\u2011250\u202fbpm) with either absent P waves or retrograde P waves; the rhythm is not irregular.  \n\n**4. Differential Diagnosis**  \n- **AVNRT** \u2013 unlikely: would be regular, not irregular, and would not show multiple P\u2011wave morphologies.  \n- **Orthodromic AVRT** \u2013 same reasoning as AVNRT.  \n- **Atrial Flutter** \u2013 would show regular flutter waves; the ECG described shows distinct P waves, not flutter.  \n- **AF with variable block** \u2013 irregularly irregular, but the ECG would lack identifiable P waves; here multiple P\u2011wave morphologies are present.  \n- **MAT** \u2013 fits the ECG pattern (irregularly irregular, \u2265\u202f3 P\u2011wave morphologies, variable PR) and the clinical context (elderly, acute pulmonary infection, smoker).\n\n**5. Option Evaluation**  \n- **(A) AVNRT** \u2013 ruled out (regular rhythm).  \n- **(B) Multifocal atrial tachycardia** \u2013 matches both ECG and clinical scenario.  \n- **(C) Atrial fibrillation with variable block** \u2013 ECG lacks discrete P waves; ruled out.  \n- **(D) Atrial flutter** \u2013 ECG does not show flutter waves; ruled out.  \n- **(E) Orthodromic AVRT** \u2013 regular rhythm; ruled out.\n\n**6. Clinical Decision**  \nThe most appropriate diagnosis is **Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia (MAT)**, which is commonly precipitated by acute pulmonary pathology in older patients.\n\n**Final Answer: B**"

The classic sequence is:\n   - Early coagulative necrosis (eosinophilic, loss of nuclei)\n   - Acute inflammation with neutrophils (\u2248\u202f24\u201172\u202fh)\n   - Macrophage\u2011mediated cleanup (\u2248\u202f3\u20117\u202fdays)\n   - Granulation tissue (fibroblasts, capillaries, \u2248\u202f7\u201110\u202fdays)\n   - Mature collagen scar (weeks)\n\n2. **Clinical information** \u2013 The patient had an acute MI, was stable, then on hospital day\u202f5 developed sudden hypotension, tachycardia, JVD and dyspnea \u2013 a classic time\u2011frame for a mechanical complication (e.g., papillary\u2011muscle rupture, ventricular\u2011septal rupture). The question, however, asks what the myocardial biopsy would show **at this point in time**, i.e., the histologic appearance of the infarcted myocardium on day\u202f5.\n\n3. **Medical knowledge** \u2013 Histopathology of myocardial infarction evolves predictably:\n   - **0\u201124\u202fh:** early coagulative necrosis, wavy fibers.\n   - **1\u20113\u202fdays:** extensive neutrophilic infiltrate.\n   - **3\u20117\u202fdays:** abundant macrophages (yellow softening of the tissue) that phagocytose dead cells.\n   - **7\u201110\u202fdays:** granulation tissue with fibroblasts and neovascularization.\n   - **>2\u202fweeks:** collagen scar.\n\n   On day\u202f5 the dominant feature is **macrophage infiltration**.\n\n4. **Differential diagnosis** \u2013 The mechanical complications themselves do not change the histologic stage of the infarct; they simply occur when the tissue is at the macrophage\u2011mediated \u201csoftening\u201d phase. Therefore the biopsy would not show neutrophils (earlier) nor mature granulation tissue (later).\n\n5. **Option evaluation** \u2013 Assuming the answer\u2011choice figures follow the typical textbook sequence:\n   - **Figure\u202fA:** early coagulative necrosis.\n   - **Figure\u202fB:** neutrophil\u2011rich acute inflammation.\n   - **Figure\u202fC:** abundant macrophages (yellow softening).\n   - **Figure\u202fD:** granulation tissue (fibroblasts, capillaries).\n   - **Figure\u202fE:** mature collagen scar.\n\n   The description that matches day\u202f5 is **Figure\u202fC**.\n\n6. **Clinical decision** \u2013 The most likely histologic picture on myocardial biopsy on day\u202f5 after an MI is the macrophage\u2011dominant phase.\n\n**Final Answer: C**"
