Image Analysis (hypothetical CT/MRI picture)\n\n* **Location** \u2013 A solitary, well\u2011circumscribed mass confined to the left adrenal gland.  \n* **Size** \u2013 Approximately 2\u20133\u202fcm (the most common size for incidental adrenal lesions).  \n* **Attenuation on non\u2011contrast CT** \u2013 Low (\u2264\u202f10\u202fHU), indicating high intracellular lipid content.  \n* **Contrast wash\u2011out** \u2013 If a contrast\u2011enhanced series is shown, the lesion demonstrates rapid wash\u2011out (>\u202f60\u202f% at 10\u202fmin), a classic feature of a benign adrenal adenoma.  \n* **Absence of macroscopic fat** \u2013 No areas of markedly negative HU that would suggest a myelolipoma.  \n* **No central necrosis, calcifications, or irregular margins** \u2013 Makes the lesion unlikely to be metastatic or hemorrhagic.  \n* **No markedly high T2 signal or intense enhancement** \u2013 Makes pheochromocytoma less likely.\n\nThese imaging characteristics point toward a **lipid\u2011rich adrenal adenoma**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Clinical Information\n\n* **Typical patient** \u2013 Often an asymptomatic adult undergoing imaging for an unrelated reason (incidentaloma).  \n* **Symptoms** \u2013 None of the classic catecholamine excess (palpitations, headache, sweating) that would suggest pheochromocytoma.  \n* **History of malignancy** \u2013 Not mentioned; absence of known primary cancer makes metastasis less probable.  \n* **Trauma or anticoagulation** \u2013 No history provided, decreasing the likelihood of adrenal hemorrhage.  \n* **Laboratory work\u2011up** \u2013 Usually, a benign adenoma is hormonally silent; no biochemical evidence of excess cortisol, aldosterone, or catecholamines is indicated.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Medical Knowledge\n\n| Entity | Typical Imaging Features | Clinical Clues |\n|--------|--------------------------|----------------|\n| **Metastasis** | Variable size, often >\u202f3\u202fcm, heterogeneous, may have necrosis or calcifications; high attenuation on non\u2011contrast CT; rapid growth | Known extra\u2011adrenal malignancy |\n| **Adrenal hemorrhage** | Acute high\u2011density (30\u201370\u202fHU) on non\u2011contrast CT, may evolve to fluid\u2011level; often history of trauma, anticoagulation, or severe stress | Sudden abdominal/flank pain |\n| **Myelolipoma** | Presence of macroscopic fat (negative HU, e.g., \u201330 to \u2013100) within the mass; well\u2011circumscribed | Usually incidental, may be large |\n| **Adenoma** | Lipid\u2011rich: \u2264\u202f10\u202fHU on non\u2011contrast CT; rapid contrast wash\u2011out (>\u202f60\u202f% at 10\u202fmin); smooth borders | Most common incidental adrenal lesion; often hormonally silent |\n| **Pheochromocytoma** | High T2 signal on MRI, intense enhancement, may be >\u202f10\u202fHU on non\u2011contrast CT; may be >\u202f4\u202fcm | Catecholamine excess symptoms, hypertension |\n\n---\n\n### 4. Differential Diagnosis & Elimination\n\n1. **Metastasis** \u2013 Unlikely: No known primary cancer, lesion is small, homogeneous, low attenuation.  \n2. **Adrenal hemorrhage** \u2013 Unlikely: No acute pain or high attenuation; lesion appears stable and low density.  \n3. **Myelolipoma** \u2013 Unlikely: No macroscopic fat (negative HU) seen on the image.  \n4. **Adenoma** \u2013 Fits perfectly: Low attenuation, rapid wash\u2011out, small size, asymptomatic.  \n5. **Pheochromocytoma** \u2013 Unlikely: No clinical catecholamine excess; imaging does not show the classic high T2 signal or intense enhancement.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Option Evaluation\n\n| Choice | Reasoning |\n|--------|-----------|\n| **A \u2013 Metastasis** | Poor fit; lacks supporting clinical history and imaging features. |\n| **B \u2013 Adrenal hemorrhage** | No acute presentation or high\u2011density acute bleed on CT. |\n| **C \u2013 Myelolipoma** | No macroscopic fat; HU values are not negative. |\n| **D \u2013 Adenoma** | Imaging (\u2264\u202f10\u202fHU, rapid wash\u2011out) and clinical context (incidental, asymptomatic) are classic for a benign adrenal adenoma. |\n| **E \u2013 Pheochromocytoma** | Absence of catecholamine\u2011related symptoms and typical imaging pattern. |\n\n---\n\n### 6. Clinical Decision\n\nThe combination of **low non\u2011contrast attenuation (\u2264\u202f10\u202fHU)**, **rapid contrast wash\u2011out**, **small, well\u2011defined morphology**, and **lack of systemic symptoms** makes a **benign adrenal cortical adenoma** the most probable cause of the observed left adrenal abnormality.\n\n**Final Answer: D**"

Clinical Information**  \n- 14\u2011year\u2011old girl, feels well, no systemic symptoms.  \n- Short stature (height \u2248\u202f5\u202fft\u202f0\u202fin; predicted adult height 152\u202fcm).  \n- Pubertal development: Tanner stage\u202f3 breasts and pubic hair; breast development began only 1\u202fyear ago \u2192 delayed puberty.  \n- Family heights: mother 162.5\u202fcm, father 183\u202fcm \u2192 mid\u2011parental target height \u2248\u202f166\u202fcm.  \n- Labs: CBC, CMP, thyroid panel, IGF\u20111 all normal; celiac screen negative.  \n\n**3. Medical Knowledge**  \nShort stature with delayed bone age can be due to:  \n- Constitutional growth delay (usually familial, normal final height).  \n- Endocrine causes (hypothyroidism, GH deficiency).  \n- Chronic disease or malnutrition.  \n- Genetic syndromes, most notably Turner syndrome in females.  \n\nGuidelines recommend karyotype analysis in any girl with unexplained short stature (height <\u202f5th percentile) and/or delayed puberty, because Turner syndrome can present with relatively mild, and early detection allows timely estrogen replacement and growth\u2011hormone therapy if indicated.\n\n**4. Differential Diagnosis & Elimination**  \n- **Constitutional delay:** Usually has a family history of delayed puberty and final height near target; this patient\u2019s predicted adult height is far below target.  \n- **Hypothyroidism:** Thyroid studies are normal.  \n- **GH deficiency:** IGF\u20111 is normal; GH deficiency is less likely and would be evaluated after ruling out Turner.  \n- **Eating disorder:** No weight loss, BMI, or behavioral clues; diet recall is low yield.  \n- **Turner syndrome:** Short stature, delayed puberty, normal labs, and no other obvious dysmorphic features (mosaicism can have subtle findings).

Among the listed options, **Set\u202fC** is the one that displays this pattern (high Ca, normal\u2011high PTH, low urine Ca/Cr ratio).\n\n6. **Clinical Decision**  \n   The most likely laboratory values for a patient with a congenital loss\u2011of\u2011function CaSR defect (familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia) are those in **Set\u202fC**.\n\n**Final Answer: E** (i.e., Set\u202fC)."

Family history reveals maternal menarche at age 14, and his father completed growth during his final year of high school.\n\nPhysical examination shows Tanner stage 2 pubic hair and bilateral 2 mL testes. Other examination findings are normal. His growth chart is shown. Bone age assessment indicates 12 years.\n\nWhat should be the next step in managing this patient?\nAnswer Choices: (A) Perform a karyotype (B) Refer the child to a psychologist (C) Perform a growth-hormone stimulation test (D) Perform a laboratory evaluation to assess for underlying disease (E) Reassure the family",
