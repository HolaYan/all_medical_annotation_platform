Clinical Information**  \n- 45\u2011year\u2011old carpenter, acute traumatic hand injury.  \n- No signs of infection, vascular compromise, or tendon exposure.  \n- Goal: rapid, durable coverage that preserves sensation and allows early return to work.  \n\n**3. Medical Knowledge**  \nThe **island volar advancement flap** (also called a volar V\u2011Y or \u201cisland\u201d flap) is a local, neurovascular\u2011preserving flap harvested from the volar skin of the same digit. It is based on the digital artery perforators and can be advanced 1\u20132\u202fcm without excessive tension.  \n\nKey points from hand\u2011surgery textbooks and current guidelines:  \n\n- It is indicated for **defects of the fingertip/pulp** that are **\u2264\u202f2\u202fcm** in greatest dimension.  \n- Larger defects (>\u202f2\u202fcm) risk flap necrosis or require alternative flaps (cross\u2011finger, thenar, or free tissue transfer).  \n- The flap can reliably cover defects up to **2\u20132.5\u202fcm**; beyond this the donor site cannot be closed primarily and the risk of vascular compromise rises.\n\n**4. Differential Diagnosis (of appropriate flap choice)**  \n- **Cross\u2011finger flap** \u2013 used for larger volar defects (>\u202f2\u202fcm) or when the donor digit can be sacrificed.  \n- **Thenar flap** \u2013 for thumb defects, not appropriate here.  \n- **Free toe\u2011pulp flap** \u2013 reserved for very large or complex defects.  \n- **Island volar advancement flap** \u2013 best match for a moderate\u2011size volar defect in the same digit.\n\n**5. Option Evaluation**  \n\n| Choice | Size range | Consistency with flap capability |\n|--------|------------|-----------------------------------|\n| A | 2\u20112.5\u202fcm | Matches the upper limit reported for island volar advancement flaps. |\n| B | <\u202f1\u202fcm | Too small; the flap can certainly cover this but the question asks for the **maximum** size. |\n| C | 1.5\u20112\u202fcm | Within the range, but does not represent the maximal reported coverage. |\n| D | 2.5\u20113.5\u202fcm | Exceeds the safe limit; such defects usually need a different flap. |\n| E | 1\u20111.5\u202fcm | Also below the maximal capacity. |\n\n**6. Clinical Decision**  \nThe island volar advancement flap is reliably used for defects up to about **2\u20132.5\u202fcm** in greatest dimension. Therefore, the correct answer is the range that includes this maximal size.\n\n**Final Answer: A**"

Medical Knowledge**  \n- **Iron\u2011deficiency anemia** in a middle\u2011aged man is most often due to chronic occult gastrointestinal blood loss, frequently from a gastric or duodenal malignancy.  \n- **Acanthosis nigricans** (hyperpigmented velvety plaques in axillae, neck, groin) can be **malignant** when it appears abruptly in an adult and is associated with gastric adenocarcinoma.  \n- **Tripe palms** (thickened, velvety palms) are another cutaneous paraneoplastic sign strongly linked to gastric cancer.  \n- **Metformin** can cause vitamin\u202fB12 deficiency \u2192 macrocytic anemia, not microcytic.  \n- **Diabetes mellitus** can cause acanthosis nigricans, but usually chronic and associated with insulin resistance; it does not cause iron\u2011deficiency anemia.  \n- **Sarcoidosis** may cause hypercalcemia and anemia of chronic disease, not a microcytic picture.  \n- **Tinea capitis** is a scalp fungal infection, unrelated to the described rash or anemia.\n\n**4. Differential Diagnosis**  \n- **Iron\u2011deficiency anemia due to chronic GI blood loss** \u2192 most likely gastric cancer.  \n- **Medication\u2011induced anemia** (metformin \u2192 B12 deficiency) \u2192 macrocytic, not fitting labs.  \n- **Diabetes\u2011related skin changes** \u2192 could cause acanthosis nigricans but would not explain acute rash and iron\u2011deficiency anemia.  \n- **Sarcoidosis** \u2192 would present with other systemic signs and a different anemia pattern.  \n- **Tinea capitis** \u2192 irrelevant to axillae/palms and anemia.\n\n**5. Option Evaluation**  \n\n| Choice | Reasoning |\n|--------|-----------|\n| **A \u2013 Tinea capitis** | Fungal scalp infection; does not cause axillary/palmar rash or microcytic anemia. |\n| **B \u2013 Diabetes mellitus** | Can cause chronic acanthosis nigricans, but the rash is acute and the anemia pattern points to iron loss, not diabetes. |\n| **C \u2013 Gastric cancer** | Explains iron\u2011deficiency anemia (occult GI bleed) and paraneoplastic skin findings (acanthosis nigricans, tripe palms). Fits all data. |\n| **D \u2013 Metformin** | Causes B12 deficiency \u2192 macrocytic anemia; labs are microcytic, so unlikely. |\n| **E \u2013 Sarcoidosis** | Would produce anemia of chronic disease (normocytic/microcytic) and pulmonary/dermal lesions, not the described rash. |\n\n**6. Clinical Decision**  \nThe constellation of **iron\u2011deficiency anemia** in a middle\u2011aged man plus a **sudden acanthosis\u2011like rash in the axillae and palms** strongly points to a **paraneoplastic syndrome from gastric adenocarcinoma**.\n\n**Final Answer: C**"

Potential candidates:  \n- **MHC class I** \u2013 presents peptide to CD8\u207a T cells, not a CTLA\u20114 ligand.  \n- **MHC class II** \u2013 presents peptide to CD4\u207a T cells\u2011helper, not a CTLA\u20114 ligand.  \n- **T\u2011cell receptor (TCR)** \u2013 located on T cells, not on APCs.  \n- **CD28** \u2013 also a receptor on T cells; it binds the same ligands as CTLA\u20114 but is not on APCs.  \n- **B7 (CD80/CD86)** \u2013 expressed on APCs and is the physiological ligand for both CD28 (costimulatory) and CTLA\u20114 (inhibitory).\n\n**5.
