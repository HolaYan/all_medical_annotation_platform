MRI shows a focal central T2 hyperintensity, often with the \u201cowl\u2019s\u2011eye\u201d sign on axial images.  \n   - **Transverse myelitis** \u2013 subacute (hours\u2011days) onset, often preceded by infection/vaccination, tends to involve a longer segment of cord and shows diffuse central cord swelling without the characteristic gray\u2011matter\u2011only \u201cowl\u2019s\u2011eye\u201d pattern.  \n   - **Intramedullary astrocytoma** \u2013 slowly progressive, expansile mass with cystic components, not an abrupt presentation.  \n   - **Multiple sclerosis** \u2013 lesions are typically peripheral, short, and often accompanied by brain lesions; clinical course is relapsing\u2011remitting, not an isolated acute quadriparesis.  \n   - **ADEM** \u2013 usually in children/young adults after an infection/vaccine, with widespread brain and spinal lesions; brain MRI would be abnormal.\n\n4. **Differential diagnosis**  \n   - **Spinal cord infarction** fits the acute onset, imaging pattern (central gray\u2011matter hyperintensity, \u201cowl\u2019s\u2011eye\u201d), and limited segment involvement.  \n   - **Transverse myelitis** is less likely because the imaging shows a gray\u2011matter\u2011predominant pattern rather than diffuse cord edema, and there is no antecedent inflammatory trigger.  \n   - The other entities (astrocytoma, MS, ADEM) are inconsistent with the rapid presentation and imaging characteristics.\n\n5. **Option evaluation**  \n   - **A. Spinal cord astrocytoma** \u2013 chronic, mass\u2011like, not acute.  \n   - **B. Multiple sclerosis** \u2013 would have brain lesions and peripheral cord lesions.  \n   - **C. Spinal cord infarction** \u2013 matches acute onset, \u201cowl\u2019s\u2011eye\u201d T2 sign, short focal lesion.  \n   - **D. ADEM** \u2013 brain lesions would be present; age and presentation atypical.  \n   - **E. Transverse myelitis** \u2013 usually longer segment, diffuse edema, often preceded by infection.\n\n6. **Clinical decision**  \n   The imaging hallmark (\u201cowl\u2019s\u2011eye\u201d on axial T2) together with the sudden quadriparesis points to an **anterior spinal artery infarction** of the cervical cord.\n\n**Final Answer: C**"

Clinical Information**  \n- The abnormality is revealed only on attempted right gaze.  \n- The right eye (the abducting eye) moves outward appropriately.  \n- The left eye (the adducting eye) does not move inward.  \n- No mention of diplopia, head tilt, or vertical misalignment that would suggest a fourth\u2011nerve palsy.\n\n**3. Medical Knowledge**  \n- **Sixth (abducens) nerve palsy** \u2192 inability to abduct the affected eye. The eye would stay medially deviated and would not move outward on attempted lateral gaze.  \n- **Fourth (trochlear) nerve palsy** \u2192 vertical/torsional diplopia, worse on down\u2011and\u2011in gaze; not a primary problem with horizontal gaze.  \n- **Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO)** \u2192 lesion of the medial longitudinal fasciculus. The eye ipsilateral to the lesion cannot adduct on horizontal gaze; the contralateral abducting eye shows nystagmus. Thus, on right gaze, a left INO would present with a non\u2011adducting left eye and a normal\u2011looking right eye (often with subtle nystagmus).  \n\n**4. Differential Diagnosis**  \n- **Left 6th nerve palsy** \u2013 would cause failure of left eye abduction; the left eye would stay medially deviated on right gaze, which is the opposite of what is seen.  \n- **Right\u2011gaze\u2011induced left 4th nerve palsy** \u2013 would produce vertical/torsional misalignment, not isolated failure of adduction.  \n- **Right 6th nerve palsy** \u2013 would affect the right eye\u2019s abduction, which is normal in the image.  \n- **Right 4th nerve palsy** \u2013 would not explain the isolated horizontal deficit.  \n- **Internuclear ophthalmoplegia** \u2013 fits the pattern of a non\u2011adducting left eye on right gaze with a normally abducting right eye.\n\n**5. Option Evaluation**  \n- **A. Left fourth nerve palsy** \u2013 inconsistent with pure horizontal deficit.  \n- **B. Left sixth nerve palsy** \u2013 predicts inability to abduct the left eye, not seen.  \n- **C. Internuclear ophthalmoplegia** \u2013 matches the failure of left eye adduction on right gaze.  \n- **D. Right fourth nerve palsy** \u2013 irrelevant to horizontal gaze.  \n- **E. Right sixth nerve palsy** \u2013 would impair right\u2011eye abduction, which is normal.\n\n**6. Clinical Decision**  \nThe findings are classic for an internuclear ophthalmoplegia affecting the left medial longitudinal fasciculus.\n\n**Final Answer: C (Internuclear ophthalmoplegia)**"

Medical Knowledge**  \n- Spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is most common in IV drug users, diabetics, and immunocompromised patients.  \n- Classic triad: back/neck pain, fever, neurologic deficits (often incomplete).  \n- MRI with gadolinium is the diagnostic gold standard; it shows a rim\u2011enhancing epidural collection.  \n- Management depends on neurologic status:  \n  \u2022 **No deficits** \u2013 can be treated with IV antibiotics \u00b1 percutaneous drainage.  \n  \u2022 **Neurologic deficits** \u2013 require **urgent surgical decompression** (usually posterior laminectomy/laminotomy) plus broad\u2011spectrum IV antibiotics.  \n- Anterior decompression/fusion is reserved for cases where the infection destroys the vertebral body or disc space causing instability/compression from the front.  \n- High\u2011dose steroids are contraindicated in infectious compression (they may worsen infection).  \n- CT\u2011guided biopsy is reserved when the diagnosis is uncertain and the patient is neurologically intact.\n\n**4. Differential Diagnosis**  \n- **Spinal epidural abscess** \u2013 fits IV drug use, MRI findings, progressive weakness.  \n- Vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis with epidural extension \u2013 would show vertebral body destruction; not prominent here.  \n- Neoplastic epidural mass \u2013 less likely in this age group and risk profile; MRI appearance (rim enhancement, rapid progression) favors infection.  \n- Acute traumatic spinal cord injury \u2013 no trauma history.  \n\n**5. Option Evaluation**  \n\n| Choice | Reasoning |\n|--------|-----------|\n| **A. Broad\u2011spectrum IV antibiotics and bracing** | Appropriate for SEA **without** neurologic deficit. This patient already has cord compression with weakness \u2192 insufficient. |\n| **B. Anterior decompression and fusion** | Reserved for anterior vertebral body collapse/instability. MRI does not show significant vertebral destruction; posterior approach is less invasive for pure epidural pus. |\n| **C. CT\u2011guided biopsy** | Useful when diagnosis is unclear. Here MRI clearly shows an epidural abscess and the patient is neurologically deteriorating \u2192 delay is unsafe. |\n| **D. Posterior decompression and fusion** | Provides rapid evacuation of the epidural pus, decompression of the cord, and stabilizes the spine if needed. This is the standard of care for SEA with neurologic deficits. |\n| **E. High\u2011dose methylprednisolone** | Indicated for acute traumatic spinal cord injury, not for infectious compression; steroids can worsen infection. |\n\n**6. Clinical Decision**  \nThe patient has an MRI\u2011confirmed cervical epidural abscess with evolving myelopathy. The evidence\u2011based, guideline\u2011supported next step is **urgent surgical decompression via a posterior approach (laminectomy) with fusion as needed**, followed by appropriate IV antibiotics.\n\n**Final Answer: D**"
